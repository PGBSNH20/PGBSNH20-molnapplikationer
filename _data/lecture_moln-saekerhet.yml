        When Tailwind Traders acquired Northwind Traders, we needed a way to teach employees at Northwind how security in the cloud is different than security in our on-premises data centers. In this talk we’ll show you how we used Azure Security Center to scan our resources and help us manage threat protection and monitoring of our SQL Database. As our security scan is happening, we’ll then implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and assign our IT professionals roles within our cloud using Identity and Access Management. Finally, when our security scan is complete, we’ll implement the recommendations from the Azure Security Center and watch as our risk indicators go from red to orange to yellow!
