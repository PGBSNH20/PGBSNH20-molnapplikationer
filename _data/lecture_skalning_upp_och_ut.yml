      description: >
        Modern-day data centers are extremely complex and have many moving parts. VMs can restart or move, systems are upgraded, and file servers are scaled up and down. All these events are to be expected in a cloud environment. However, you can make your cloud application resilient to these events by following best practices. This document outlines 13 crucial steps that you can take to ensure that your app is cloud ready. By taking these steps, you will ensure that any events in the data center will have negligible effects on your app and that your app will be more resilient and future proof.

        Your infrastructure doesn't just exist in your building or your physical data center anymore. Critical applications and services can live anywhere. What started with hardware virtualization has evolved to services in the cloud. Wherever your critical services live, it’s important your users can continue to operate without interruption. This means one thing: monitoring. Join SolarWinds VP of Product Strategy Brandon Shopp and Microsoft Senior Cloud Advocate Pierre Roman for a frank discussion about overcoming the challenges as your environment scales out.

        Abstract: 
        Distributed systems create threats to resilience that are not addressed by classical approaches to development and testing. We’ve passed the point where individual humans can reasonably navigate these systems at scale. As we embrace a world that emphasizes automation and engineering over architecting, we left gaps open in our understanding of complex systems. 
        
        Chaos Engineering is a new discipline within Software Engineering, building confidence in the behavior of distributed systems at scale. SREs and dedicated practitioners adopt Chaos Engineering as a practical tool for improving resiliency. An explicit, empirical approach provides a formal framework for adopting, implementing, and measuring the success of a Chaos Engineering program. Additional best practices define an ideal implementation, establishing the gold standard for this nascent discipline. 
        
        Chaos Engineering isn’t the process of creating chaos, but rather surfacing chaos that is inherent in the behavior of these systems at scale. By focusing on high level business metric, we side step understanding *how* a particular model works in order to identify *whether* it work under realistic, turbulent conditions in production. This fills a gap that arms SREs with a better, holistic understanding of the system’s behavior.
