        Azure Functions embody the concept of SRP. Whether you are looking to go full out on microservices or are just looking for a way to add a lot of power to your application with little effort, Azure Functions can help you out. They are quick to build, easy to maintain, and are powerful to operate. The best part is that while they run in Microsoft Azure, they are almost always free. In this video, we are going to look at how to build Azure Functions, how to deploy them, and walk through scenarios where we might use them.
