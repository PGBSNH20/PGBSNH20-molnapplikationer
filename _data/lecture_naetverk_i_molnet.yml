        For the past years one of the IT mega trends has been "the cloud". Many companies are rushing to the public cloud because it's easy for them and quite honestly...because everybody else is doing so.
        
        But it's not really "the cloud" what everybody wants - it's the frictionless CLOUD EXPERIENCE that we love. Like all larger companies very well know, that same cloud experience can be achieved with building your own PRIVATE CLOUD. The difference is that private cloud exceeds the capabilities of public cloud, listing a few examples:
        - More control over your precious business critical data
        - More hardware and software security
        - More infrastructure and application agility
        
        And the best part is, when you design and implement your private cloud using the best technologies from trusted vendors, private cloud will become significantly less expensive than using the same services from public cloud.
        
        Join me with my introduction on the differencies between traditional data centers, public cloud and private cloud.

        A virtual private cloud is a public cloud capability that provides you the ability to define and control isolated virtual networks, and then deploy cloud resources into those networks.

        Azure Queue Storage is simple yet powerful service for storing large number of messages. It is one of core services for implementing scenarios like load-leveling, fan-out, fan-in and those relying on retry capabilities.
        
        In this episode I give you introduction to what Storage Queue service is. How can you provision it, what are the typical scenarios that you would want to leverage its capabilities?
        
        In this episodes live demo of
        - Creating queue storage
        - Managing queues and their data
        - Implementing fan-out scenario using Logic Apps and Queues

        Microservices are an essential enabler of agility but developing and deploying them is a challenge.
        In order for microservices to be loosely coupled,each service must have its own datastore.
        This makes it difficult to maintain data consistency across services.
        Deploying microservices is also a complex problem since an application typically consists of 10s or 100s of services, written in a variety of languages and frameworks.
        In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these problems by using an event-driven architecture to maintain data consistency and by using Docker to simplify deployment.
